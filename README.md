# ds-faiss-utils

Some scripts to load a semantic space in dense matrix format, and perform calculations using the FAISS library (install from https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss).

Available:

* analogy calculation (e.g. king - man = queen - woman)
* nearest neighbours calculation
* similarity evaluation, using the MEN dataset.

See USAGE in each .py file. You will have to change paths to match your directory structure.
